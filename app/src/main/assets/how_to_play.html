    The rules in Minesweeper are simple:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares
            are safe to click.
        </p>

    Hints and tips
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
    Mark the mines. If you suspect a square conceals a mine, long-press it. This puts a flag on the square. (If you're not sure, long-press again to remove the
    flag.)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Study the patterns. If three squares in a row display 2-3-2, then you know three mines are probably lined up beside that row. If a square says 8, every
    surrounding square is mined.
</p>
<p>
    Explore the unexplored. Not sure where to click next? Try clearing some unexplored territory. You're better off clicking in the middle of unmarked squares
    than in an area you suspect is mined.
